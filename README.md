# Git_Account_Check
In this Android Project, I am working with github api.


In this project we use, following link :

for github api : https://api.github.com/ <br>
                 https://api.github.com/user
  
  <br>
  
  For image downloading, i am using most powerful library Picasso<br>
  https://github.com/square/picasso <br>
  in your gradle you should add<br>
  compile 'com.squareup.picasso:picasso:2.5.2'
